## Introduction

This project, carried out within the 4th year of Industrial Computing and Automation (IIA4) at INSAT, delves into the modeling and optimal control of a complex dynamical system. Utilizing a blend of simulation tools, optimization techniques, and reinforcement learning algorithms, the project aims to achieve stability and control in a challenging physical setup.

## Project Scope

From March 29, 2023, to May 15, 2023, the project team undertook a comprehensive exploration of various control strategies and simulation environments. Led by a dedicated group of individuals, the project focused on bridging theoretical concepts with practical implementations to tackle the inherent complexities of the DIP system.

## Key Features

- **LabVIEW Simulation with LQ Controller**: Implementation of a LabVIEW simulation featuring an LQ controller on Quanser's DIP platform, showcasing effective stabilization despite significant disturbances.
- **Python-LabVIEW Integration**: Seamless integration between Python-based swing-up control simulation and LabVIEW through a CSV data conversion block diagram, facilitating reusable data exchange between platforms.
- **ROS-Integrated Gazebo Simulation**: Simulation of a precision-tuned LQ controller for a ROS-modeled DIP system in Gazebo, resulting in a notable 20% enhancement in upper link stability.
- **Reinforcement Learning Optimization**: Fine-tuning of an optimal control policy using reinforcement learning techniques, achieving impressive performance with a DDPG model, surpassing DQN-based approaches in stability and effectiveness.
