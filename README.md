# Double Inverted Pendulum on a Cart: Non-Linear System Modeling and Control Simulation
- Developed Python swing-up control strategy for a Double-Inverted Pendulum, achieving 40% faster execution time through cloud computing.
- Implemented an LQR controller for a ROS-modeled robot simulating the DIP system, identifying areas for improved stability in upper links.
- Trained RL models (DDPG, DQL) using OpenAI PyBulletGym, achieving an expected return of 930 and high-quality optimal control policies.
